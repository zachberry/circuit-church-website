Nat Evans' "My Old Friend Death" is a feast of lush strings, floating guitar tones, and hovering synth textures woven together with collected field recordings. The album features contributions from cellist Lori Goldston and guitarist Will Hayes, with recorded chants by Soto Zen priest Hoitsu Suzuki Roshi.
