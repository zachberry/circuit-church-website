The first release from Orlando's Super Passive is a whirlwind trip through New Wave and Post Punk moods. The EP opens with Radio, a soaring synth-fueled pop anthem. Renegades floats along on a punctuated melody while decrying authoritarian ideas. On Beautiful Nightmare, Furrevig's plea for living without self-imposed limits rises up alongside a swirling guitar melody and driving bassline. The EP closes with Too Late To Turn Back Time on which Furrevig lyrically confronts the balance of living with regrets while practicing radical self-acceptance in a track made for the dance floor.

The cassette version of Super Passive's Radio EP. J-Card includes printed lyrics. Recorded on FerroMaster C256â„¢ high performance Type-1 music grade tape at NAC.
